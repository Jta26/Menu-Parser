React is a javascript front-end framework used to make creating interactive content online simple and modular. The blog selection bar, and blog content is pulled from a JSON file on the server, that is to be manually updated when I make a new blog post. The choice to program my own blog instead of using a service like wordpress is to exmplify my front-end development ability. My capstone project is going to involve all facets of full-stack development, including data retrieve and organization scripts, databases, RESTful API back-end technologies, and front-end development frameworks such as React.\n test"],"images":[{"src":"https://i.imgur.com/gTvLu4t.png","width":2,"height":1},{"src":"https://i.imgur.com/U4QZeGh.png","width":1.5,"height":1},{"src":"https://i.imgur.com/GqV2Vh5.png","width":2,"height":1}]}];
